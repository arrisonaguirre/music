music app
=====
ello, 
some ideas for what the app could display information about: 

-required equipment and brand suggestions

-instrumental techniques

-fingering charts -(including lists of alternate fingerings)

-music exercises

-breathing exercises

-how to read treble and bass clef

and play audio for tuning notes (and maybe exercises?)

-metronome?

-allow for short recordings & be able to name them (could be in the exercise section so kids could record themselves playing the exercises to show to tutors?)

oh hai
